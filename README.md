# 4SUseq
Analysis of 4SU(4-thiouridine) labeled (and unlabeled) total RNA samples. This pipeline is designed specifically for analysis of samples generated under project **RBL-4**

## RBL-4
### Description: 

To investigate newly synthesized transcripts, RNAs in mouse stem cells (WT and Ro-/-) are labeled with 4SU, extracted and treated to generate T to C mutations in the final library following slam-seq protocol. We would like to compare the labeled RNA levels in WT and Ro-/-.
